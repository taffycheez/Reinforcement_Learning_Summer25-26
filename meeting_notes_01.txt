# Q - LEARNING

Q-TABLE: States x Actions Q(s,a)=expected result of action a in state s if the player continues to play optimally.

1 = WIN, 0 = TIE, -1 = LOSE
States = all legitimate game situations

3^9 rough upper limit

n(x)=n(o), n(x)=n(o)+1
only one row/column/diagonal of either x or o

s		a		Q(s,a)
"xx_oo_xo_"     3		1 (x win)
"xx_oo_xo_"     6		0 (tie)
"xx_oo_xo_"     9		-1  (if 0's go for a=6 Player-o is optimal)
				0.5*0+0.5*(-1)=-0.5    (Player-o is random)

"xx_o__xo_"

TASK 1: create a list of all possible states
TASK 2: fill up the Q-table (for x and o) when playing against the optimal opponent [bonus: random opponent]

TASK: FILL UP THE Q_table

### REINFORCEMENT LEARNING:
1. assign Q(s,a) table some initial values (0)
2. Play a game (using the current Q(s,a) table) and record s, a, s' [resulting state] and the final outcome Q
3. Update Q'(s,a) = (1-alpha)*Q(s,a) + alpha*(r+max Q(s',a))

s			a	r	s'
'_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _' 	1	0	'x _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _'
'x _ _ _ o _ _ _ _'	2	0	'x x _ _ o _ _ _ _'
'x x _ _ o _ _ _ o'	3	1	'x x x _ o _ _ _ o'

TASK: write a function for playing a game, given [current] Q-table
In each state s, choose action a based on the Q-table
- random (choose one of the available options) [not reinforcement learning]
- optimal (choose the best possible option) argmax_a Q(s,a) [EXPLOITATION]
- choose move a with probability depending on Q(s,a) [EXPLORE options] Keep in mind -1 < Q < 1.

0 <= alpha <= 1 is the learning rate. (TRY DIFFERENT LEVELS).

= produce Q-table

### QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. What is the best first move for x when playing against optimal opponent (o)
2. What is the best first move for x when playing against random opponent (o)
3. What is the distribution of wins/losses/ties when playing against optimal/random (o) being trained on optimal/random
